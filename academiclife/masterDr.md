# Master and Doctorate Degree     
Following are the glimpses of the learning method for postgraduate/doctorate in a typical University in the UK, information is taken from the University of Manchester.    

## Postgraduate Taught(PGT)    
Methods and materials for master’s and taught courses     
As a student on a master’s or other postgraduate taught course at The University of Manchester, you’ll benefit from our excellence in teaching methods and the very best learning environments and materials.    

As well as this, you’ll learn from leading teachers and scholars who are acknowledged international experts in their respective fields.     

You’ll develop skills and gain experience that will be fundamental to your future career. We employ a wide variety of teaching techniques, from traditional laboratory-based work, lectures, and seminars to e-learning.     

**How we teach on postgraduate courses**     
Teaching and learning methods at the postgraduate level can be quite different from those at the undergraduate level. How you are taught will largely depend on your course content, level of study, and your academic tutor – but, however you are taught, you will be required to undertake a large proportion of your study independently.     

Since most of our master’s courses are only one year in duration, the academic experience can be quite intense compared to an undergraduate degree. As a master’s student, you will begin to specialize in topics that interest you or start to work on a particular area of research that you may wish to undertake for further study.    

Studying at a postgraduate level involves a greater emphasis on self-directed study than at an undergraduate level. You’ll be expected to think and study independently, conduct more extensive background reading, and bring your ideas to seminars and tutorials for discussion and debate.

## Postgraduate Research(PGR) and Doctorate    
There are several programs available for the research-based postgraduate/doctoral program at the University of Manchester:     

### Research Master's    
a 12-month program including subject-specific taught course units, research skills training and a substantial research project, or series of research projects. Research master's degrees include the MSc by Research and the Master of Enterprise (MEnt).    

### Master of Philosophy (MPhil)    
usually lasting 12 months and assessed by the submission and examination of a shorter thesis than that required for a Ph.D., setting out the results of an original, individual program of investigational research. Where appropriate, successful completion of the MPhil (including the preparation of a detailed plan for a doctoral research project) may be followed by registration for a Ph.D.
